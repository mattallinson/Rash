# RiskRoller
A python coded dice roller for Risk

Uses the Python inbuilt random number generater to create rolls and compares the result. Will stop when either the defender runs our of armies, or the number of attacking armies drops below 4.

## Further work
* change it so the attacker can specify if they want to stop either before they get to only 4 armies, or if they want to keep rolling until only 1 army surivies
* change how the code is structured to allow for the latter scenario to work
* let players use different numbers of dice

## Future Project
* write this in JavaScript so I can host it on a website easily (need to learn JavaScript)
